# Trello Clone

## About project
    It's a trello application clone created using MERN STACK in which I have used JWT tokens to authenticate user and to create an interactive UI using react bootstrap and materialized CSS. For backend I have used NODE.JS and EXPRESS. For database I have used MONGODB using mongoose and hosted database on MONGODB atlas.

    In this screenshot I have illustrated dashboard of application, where user can see the boards either if he created that board or he added by someone else on that board.

    In this screenshot I have illustrated list of tasks defined by user, current users and a search bar. With the help of search bar user can add another user by searching their email-ID. Added userâ€™s avatar can be viewed in the UI. Task also created on this page by clicking on create button.
